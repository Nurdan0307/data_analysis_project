# # Capstone Project: Data Analysis on Northwind Dataset

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project using the Northwind dataset. The project involves SQL queries, Python analyses, and Power BI visualizations. The objective is to analyze the company's sales performance, examine customer behavior, and evaluate supplier relationships.

## Project Overview

### Dataset Used
- **Northwind Dataset:** This dataset includes sales data from a trading company. It contains various tables such as Customer Information, Order Details, Products, Employees, Suppliers, and Shipping Information.

### 1. SQL Queries
- **File:** `northwind_sql_queries.sql`
- **Description:** This file contains SQL queries performed on the dataset. The analyses include:
  - **Sales Performance Analysis:** Analysis of annual and monthly sales trends.
  - **Customer Segmentation:** Customers were segmented based on their total spending.
  - **Supplier Analysis:** Evaluation of supplier sales performance.
  - **Stock Turnover Analysis:** Calculation of stock turnover rates for the products.

### 2. Python Analysis
- **File:** `northwind_analysis.ipynb`
- **Description:** Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization were performed using Python. Key analyses include:
  - **Sales Trend Analysis:** Time series analysis of sales trends.
  - **Customer Behavior Analysis:** Analysis of order frequency and repeat customers.
  - **Product Performance:** Evaluation of product sales performance and profitability.
- **Libraries Used:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`

### 3. Power BI Dashboard
- **File:** `northwind_dashboard.pbix`
- **Description:** An interactive dashboard created using Power BI to visualize the data. The dashboard includes:
  - **Overall Sales Performance:** Visual representation of annual and monthly sales trends.
  - **Product Sales Charts:** Most sold products and sales by category.
  - **Supplier Analysis:** Evaluation of sales performance by supplier.
  - **Customer Segmentation:** Visualization of customer spending segments in Power BI.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL:** Data extraction and analysis were performed using PostgreSQL.
- **Python:** Used for data analysis and visualization.
- **Power BI:** Enabled interactive data visualization.

## Installation and Usage
1. **SQL Queries:** Run the queries in `northwind_sql_queries.sql` on your PostgreSQL database.
2. **Python Analysis:** Open and execute `northwind_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or your preferred IDE.
3. **Power BI Dashboard:** Open the `northwind_dashboard.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop to explore the visualizations.
